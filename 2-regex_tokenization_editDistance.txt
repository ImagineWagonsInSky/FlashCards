{
    "What is ELIZA, and how does it relate to natural language processing?": "ELIZA was an early chatbot that used pattern matching to simulate a conversation, showing how simple text transformations can create the illusion of understanding.",
    "What is text normalization?": "The process of converting text into a standard format, including tokenization, lemmatization, and sentence segmentation.",
    "What is a regular expression?": "A pattern-matching notation used to define and search for specific sequences of text.",
    "How are regular expressions useful in NLP?": "They help extract patterns like dates, prices, or specific word forms from large text corpora.",
    "What does the regex /woodchuck/ match?": "Any occurrence of the word \"woodchuck\" in a text.",
    "What does /[A-Z]/ match?": "Any uppercase letter.",
    "How do you specify optional characters in regex?": "Using the question mark ?, e.g., /colou?r/ matches both \"color\" and \"colour.\"",
    "What does the * (Kleene star) do in regex?": "Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.",
    "What does the + (Kleene plus) do?": "Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character.",
    "How can you specify an exact number of occurrences?": "Using {n}, e.g., /a{3}/ matches \"aaa.\"",
    "What does ^ mean in regex?": "Matches the start of a line.",
    "What does $ mean in regex?": "Matches the end of a line.",
    "What does \\b signify?": "A word boundary, ensuring a match occurs at the start or end of a word.",
    "What are capture groups in regex?": "Parentheses () that store matched portions of text for reuse.",
    "How does \\1 work in regex?": "It refers back to the first capture group, e.g., /the (.*)er they were, the \\1er they will be/.",
    "What is a non-capturing group?": "(?:...), which groups characters without storing them for reference.",
    "What does (?=pattern) do?": "Matches a string only if 'pattern' follows it, without consuming characters.",
    "What does (?!pattern) do?": "Ensures a string does NOT match 'pattern' while not consuming characters.",
    "What is tokenization?": "The task of segmenting running text into words or subwords.",
    "What are the two main types of tokenization?": "Top-down (rule-based) and bottom-up (statistical-based).",
    "What are some challenges in tokenizing English?": "Handling contractions (e.g., \"I'm\" → [\"I\", \"am\"]), hyphenated words, and abbreviations.",
    "What is Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) used for?": "A subword tokenization method used in large language models to handle unknown words.",
    "How does BPE work?": "Iteratively merges frequent character pairs into new subwords.",
    "Why is BPE useful in NLP?": "It reduces the number of unknown words while keeping a manageable vocabulary size.",
    "What is lemmatization?": "The process of reducing words to their dictionary root form (e.g., \"better\" → \"good\").",
    "What is stemming?": "A cruder process that removes suffixes (e.g., \"running\" → \"runn\").",
    "What is the Porter Stemmer?": "A widely used stemming algorithm that applies transformation rules to words.",
    "What is sentence segmentation?": "The process of breaking text into individual sentences.",
    "Why is sentence segmentation difficult?": "Periods (.) can mark both sentence boundaries and abbreviations (e.g., \"Dr.\").",
    "How do NLP systems handle sentence segmentation?": "Using heuristics, machine learning, and abbreviation dictionaries.",
    "What is edit distance?": "A measure of how similar two strings are, based on insertions, deletions, and substitutions.",
    "What is Levenshtein Distance?": "The minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to convert one string into another.",
    "Where is edit distance commonly used in NLP?": "Spelling correction, speech recognition, and coreference resolution.",
    "How does dynamic programming help compute edit distance?": "By storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations."
