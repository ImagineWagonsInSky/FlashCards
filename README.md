# Flashcards

This is a current web app that i run locally from my phone or laptop to review for exams.

## üåü Features

- **Flashcard Quizzing**: Quiz yourself with your own made flashcards.
- **Similarity Evaluation**: I currently use a word embedding conversion (sentence_transformers) to evaluate the similarity between your predefined answer and the answer you put on.

> **Note**: This project is in its initial development phase, and while core features are functional, more enhancements are on the way!
